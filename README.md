# Arduino_Pulse_Rate_Sensor

An DIY Pulse Rate Sensor with an Android App to monitor the Pulse Rate.

# Hardware

For the completion of this assignment the following materials had been used : 

1. Arduino Uno Board and USB Cable.
2. Pulse Sensor Arduino
3. Jumper Wires
4. Bluetooth Module (HC-06 RS232)
5. Breadboard
6. 9V Battery

A detailed schematic can be found inside the Report.pdf file.

# Software

C Programming Language was used in all codes. Arduino IDE was necessary to upload the needed files to the Arduino Uno.

# Android App

For the creation of the App the MIT AppInventor2 has been used. Detailed schematic of the control block sequence is included in the App_Basic_Diagram.jpeg file. The Arduino Board uses a Bluetooth Module to communicate with the Mobile App and feed new data.

# Experimentation

You can see the project in action on the demostration video. Feel free to try this project on your own Arduino.
